        If you’re wondering how we automatically generated the 50–950 shades of
        each color, bad news — color is complicated and to get the absolute best
        results we picked all of Tailwind’s default colors by hand, meticulously
        balancing them by eye and testing them in real designs to make sure we
        were happy with them. If you are creating your own custom color palette
        and don’t feel confident doing it by hand, UI Colors is a great tool
        that can give you a good starting point based on any custom color. Two
        other useful tools we recommend for building your own palettes are
        Palettte and ColorBox — they won’t do the work for you but their
        interfaces are well-designed for doing this sort of work.
